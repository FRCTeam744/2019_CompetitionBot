# 2019_CompetitionBot
The official code for team 744's 2019 robot.

The documentation for the code can be found by opening /2019_CompetitionBot/SharkAttack/html/index.html

An example of the robot running with the latest code can be seen in [Hopper Qualification Match 106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF7pf5sehvA), where the robot is the one in the red bumpers with the long, black arm. And primarily in the lower left corner of the field. 

The full results for this competition season can be found at our [The Blue Alliance page](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/744/2019)
